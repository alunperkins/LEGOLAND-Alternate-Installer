_________________________________________________________________________________________
2. TECHNICAL DETAILS
_________________________________________________________________________________________

2.1 [OPERATING SYSTEM]

LEGOLAND has been designed to run on Microsoft Windows 95 & Microsoft Windows 98 only.

The game was NOT designed to run on the following operating systems:

  > Windows NT
  > OS/2
  > Linux 
  > Windows 2000
_________________________________________________________________________________________

2.2 [CPU]

Please note that a Pentium II 233 MHz MMX or equivalent is required to run the game at 
an acceptable level. A Pentium 233 MHz MMX will not be sufficient to run the game at 
acceptable levels during some of the later levels, this is due to the type of memory that 
these two processors generally run on.

NON INTEL CPU's: 
To run the game at acceptable performance levels using a non-Intel CPU, use the 
following recommendations.

 > AMD: AMD K6-II 266Mhz or higher.

 > Cyrix: Cyrix MII 300 or higher. 

 > IDT WinChip: No testing was carried out using this type CPU therefore no 
                recommendations or assumptions can or will be made.

_________________________________________________________________________________________

2.3 [MEMORY]

32MB of system RAM is required for the game to run.

Some systems may state that they have 32MB RAM installed, however, due to certain video 
adapters this may not be entirely true.

   Shared Video RAM: Some video adapters will allocate 2-4 MB of SYSTEM RAM to use as
                     Video RAM. This means your system may actually only have 28-30 MB
                     of SYSTEM RAM available.

   Dynamically Shared Video RAM: Some Video adapters can allocate SYSTEM RAM dynamically.
 				 The amount allocated can range from 0.5MB to 8MB so you
				 may have as little as 24MB of SYSTEM RAM available.


   >>>> PLEASE CONTACT YOUR HARDWARE MANUFACTURER FOR DETAILS IF YOU ARE UNSURE <<<<


Pentium II CPU's utilize SD-RAM, which is considerably faster than EDO RAM.
If you are using the older standard EDO RAM with a recommended processor you may see 
performance degradation during later levels of the game or when lots of animations 
appear onscreen.

Using Pentium II or equivalent will ensure acceptable performance 

  
LEGOLAND will perform better on systems utilizing SDRAM.


   >>>> PLEASE CONTACT YOUR HARDWARE MANUFACTURER FOR DETAILS IF YOU ARE UNSURE <<<<
_________________________________________________________________________________________

2.4 [VIDEO]

4MB of video RAM is required to run LEGOLAND. Some older model computers may come with a 
video adapter that has less than 4MB of memory. In this situation, the game may run and 
appear to function correctly, however a decrease in performance will result. It is NOT 
recommended that LEGOLAND is run on Video adapters with less than 4MB.

Video Drivers: 
What is a video driver?
A Video driver acts as a link between the video adapter (hardware) and the operating 
system and allows it to perform the functions requested by an application.

Manufacturers of Video adapters regularly publish new DRIVERS for their products. 
These are made available for FREE from their WEB site. 

If you are using old drivers for your Video adapter you may experience some unwanted 
graphical corruption while running LEGOLAND.
Graphical problems can often be resolved by updating the drivers for your video adapter.
Note: Updating the Video drivers your system uses may improve performance and solve
issues over a wide range of applications and games.

 >>>> PLEASE CONTACT YOUR HARDWARE MANUFACTURER FOR DETAILS CONCERNING DRIVERS <<<<
_________________________________________________________________________________________

2.5 [CD/DVD ROM DRIVE] 

LEGOLAND Requires a 4X CD-ROM Drive or greater. This is important when viewing the 
front-end movies when you start LEGOLAND.
SLOWER than a 4X drive will result in delayed playback during movies and possibly some
in-game delays if the MINIMUM CD installation was chosen.
SLOWER drives will also result in longer installation times.

DVD Drives usually specify 2 numbers e.g. 6X / 32X . These two numbers are the speeds at 
which data from a DVD-ROM and a CD-ROM is read. Generally the second number, 32X in this 
case, defines the speed at which data is read from a CD. 

LEGOLAND CD-ROM - The LEGOLAND CD MUST be present in the CD/DVD drive for the game to run.
_________________________________________________________________________________________

2.6 [SOUND CARD] 

LEGOLAND requires a sound card that is fully compatible with DirectX 7. This is true in 
most cases however some old legacy cards will not be compatible.

As with video adapters, updated sound card DRIVERS are regularly published by hardware 
manufacturers and are available for FREE off their web site.

If you experience any sound corruption or other sound related problems during game play, 
you should update your sound drivers. This will often solve sound related problems.


 >>>> PLEASE CONTACT YOUR HARDWARE MANUFACTURER FOR DETAILS CONCERNING DRIVERS <<<<
_________________________________________________________________________________________

2.7 [DIRECTX 7]

LEGOLAND requires the latest version of Microsoft's DirectX software to be installed on 
your system. The latest version of DirectX, DirectX 7, is supplied on the LEGOLAND 
CD-ROM. You will be asked if you wish to install the DirectX components BEFORE the 
LEGOLAND data files are transferred to your hard drive.

Choose YES when asked if you wish to update DirectX components. You will need to RESTART 
your machine for changes to take effect.

For more information and the latest updates concerning Microsoft's DirectX go to:

		http://www.microsoft.com/directx/
_________________________________________________________________________________________

2.8 [INPUT DEVICES]

LEGOLAND was designed to be played primarily with a MOUSE with only limited input from the
keyboard. 

WHEEL MOUSE:
LEGOLAND supports the use of a Wheel Mouse to scroll through in-game menus.
Users of Microsoft Windows 95A & 95B (OSR2) may need to update, their Wheel Mouse Drivers 
or install Microsoft IntelliPoint Version 2.1 or later, for the wheel function to operate 
correctly while playing LEGOLAND.

IntelliPoint 2.1 is available for download from:

		http://www.microsoft.com

LEGOLAND does NOT support the use of Joypads or Joysticks.
_________________________________________________________________________________________

2.9 [OUTPUT DEVICES]

LEGOLAND supports the use of a PRINTER, to print the LEGOLAND Park Manager Certificate on
completion of the game.

When printing the certificate, LEGOLAND will minimize and drop to your desktop, passing
the print job to your print manager software.

Please make sure that your printer is installed correctly and is on-line, ready to print.
To resume play, press the LEGOLAND tab on the TASKBAR.
_________________________________________________________________________________________

2.10 [INSTALLATION SIZE]

LEGOLAND allows you to choose from a number of installation options to best suit your 
system.

   Typical - 220MB* : This option is recommended for most users and installs ALL
			  LEGOLAND data files. The front end FMV will run from the CD.

   Minimum - 31MB* : This option can be chosen if you are running low on hard disk space
	             and installs essential files and selected resources.

   Custom - 14MB* - 400MB* : This option allows you to choose what components of LEGOLAND
		             are installed. 
		
	CORE: These files are essential and will be installed regardless of any
		      options chosen. - 14MB*

	FMV: You can choose this option to install the LEGOLAND FMV files to your hard 
                     drive. - 178MB* (FULL MOTION VIDEO)
	
	SPEECH: This option will install all the LEGOLAND speech files to your 
			hard drive. - 55MB*

	RESOURCE FILES: These are the LEGOLAND game resources.

		LEVEL DATA - 16MB*
		GRAPHICS - 19MB*
		RIDE GRAPHICS - 115MB*


The typical install will give the best in-game performance because all of the files 
will be stored on the hard drive, which allows for quicker access to data.

The minimum install may degrade performance on machines with slower CD-ROM drives,
as speech files and graphics files will be read from the CD as the game is played.

Custom install allows you to alter options to get maximum performance levels in
proportion to hard drive space. A FULL custom installation (ALL options selected) will 
require 400MB of disk space and offers the best performance.

Swapfile : Like most programs LEGOLAND requires the use of a swap file within the 
windows environment. Swapfiles act as virtual memory where, instructions and data are 
temporarily stored on the hard drive.

LEGOLAND requires 119MB approx. of free hard drive space after installation, to function
correctly.

* = Uncompressed Hard drive space - meaning that the hard drive has not been subjected
to any form of file compression which allows the hard drive space to be increased.
For example under Windows 98 the option that would usually be used to
perform this function would be DriveSpace.

3. LEGOLAND - FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
_________________________________________________________________________________________

Q. When I start LEGOLAND I get the message "You must be running in 256 color 
   mode or higher" and LEGOLAND will not run. What do I do ?

A. LEGOLAND requires that your desktop color depth is running in 256 colors or more.
   It is unlikely that you will be running at a color depth of less than 256 
   (i.e. 16 colors), however it is possible. To change you desktop colour depth :

  1. Click START on the taskbar, then choose SETTINGS > CONTROL PANEL.
  2. Choose DISPLAY from the icon list, this will bring up the DISPLAY PROPERTIES panel.
  3. Choose the SETTINGS tab, then select - High Color (16 bit) - 
  4. Apply changes and restart the machine if prompted to.

Q. When I run the LEGOLAND installer, it asks me if I want to update my DirectX 
   components.

  1. Should I do this?
  2. How do I check what version of DirectX is on my system?

A.1. YES. LEGOLAND requires DirectX 7 to be installed on your system to function 
     correctly. 
  2. The method of checking which version of DirectX is installed is the same for 
     Windows 95 and 98. Double click on My Computer and follow this path:

		C: (C Drive) > Program files > DirectX > Setup

     In the Setup folder you should see a Dxinfo icon (Dxinfo.exe) or a Dxsetup 
     (Dxsetup.exe) Icon. Running either of these will allow you to see what version of
     DirectX you have installed on your system.

Q. I updated my DirectX components, tried to run LEGOLAND after the installation and it 
   crashed to the desktop. What happened ?     

A. If you choose to update your DirectX version you MUST restart your computer after the
   installation process is complete. LEGOLAND will not function until the system has been
   restarted.


Q. LEGOLAND keeps minimizing and Windows tells me that I am running out of space on 
   Drive C:
   What should I do?

A. Windows will give you option to run the disk Clean-up utility which can delete 
   Temporary, Temporary Internet and Recycle Bin files (All can safely be deleted). This
   can free up some hard drive space.

Q. Why does my Wheel Mouse not function in LEGOLAND in-game MENUS?

A. This has been shown to occur when using Windows 95A and Windows 95B (OSR2). To solve 
   this problem you should update your Wheel Mouse drivers or install Microsoft 
   IntelliPoint Version 2.1 or greater. This is available as a FREE download at:

		http://www.microsoft.com

Q. The front-end movie plays when I start LEGOLAND but it appears to be jerky. 
   Why is this?

A. This can be due to several factors:

  1. The CD may need cleaning - remove it from the drive and use a soft cotton cloth, 
     wiping outwards from the centre of the disc.

     CD Care: 
     Compact discs are easily damaged if treated carelessly. Such damage has 
     a much greater effect on the digital data of a CD-ROM than on the 
     information of a music CD. A dirty or damaged CD-ROM is quite likely to
     malfunction. As CD-ROM drives become ever faster and more disc-sensitive, 
     this is an increasing problem. 

     The surface of the disc can quickly gather dirt and is easily scratched. 
     To protect the data from scratches, fingerprints, dust particles, and smears, 
     do not touch the data side (unlabeled side) of the disc. Also, never place it 
     face down on a hard surface. 
     
     Never leave the disc in a place subject to direct sunlight, high temperature, 
     or high humidity. Recommended storage conditions are: 

     Temperature: 10°C to 50°C (50°F to 122°F) 
     Humidity: 10 percent to 80 percent. 

     With proper care, CDs can have a long and productive life.
 
  2. Check that your CD-ROM is 4X or greater - slower drives do not meet the minimum 
     specification

  3. Some odd effects have been seen when using very high speed drives, (40X +) sometimes
     the movie will play fine and at other times it will not. Restart your computer then 
     try to run LEGOLAND again.

Q. No Sound/Music will play or is corrupted when I play LEGOLAND. What should I do ?

A. Should this problem arise you should try the following:

  1. You may be running on older drivers for your sound card. Updating these drivers may 
     solve your problems. If you have Internet access you can download the latest drivers 
     for your hardware for FREE from your hardware manufacturer's web site.
      
   >>>> PLEASE CONTACT YOUR HARDWARE MANUFACTURER FOR DETAILS IF YOU ARE UNSURE <<<<

  
  2. Other programs running within Windows may be causing conflicts. You can shut these 
     down by holding down CTRL + ALT + DEL. This will bring up the Task Manager
     (CLOSE PROGRAM BOX) allowing you to close down programs individually. Closing all 
     programs except SYSTRAY and EXPLORER, may solve your sound problems.

Q. When I start LEGOLAND I get a black screen or the game will drop back to the desktop. 
   What should I do ?

A. Should this problem arise you should try the following:

  1. You may be running on older drivers for your Video card. Updating these drivers may 
     solve your problems. If you have Internet access you can download the latest drivers 
     for your hardware for FREE from your hardware manufacturer's web site.
      
   >>>> PLEASE CONTACT YOUR HARDWARE MANUFACTURER FOR DETAILS IF YOU ARE UNSURE <<<<

  
  2. Other programs running within Windows may be causing conflicts. You can shut these 
     down by holding down CTRL + ALT + DEL. This will bring up the Task Manager
     (CLOSE PROGRAM BOX) allowing you to close down programs individually. Closing all 
     programs except SYSTRAY and EXPLORER, may solve your video problems.

  3. DirectX 7 may not be installed correctly on your system. A re-installation of 
     LEGOLAND (choosing YES when asked if you wish to update DirectX components) may 
     solve your video problems. Or you can download DirectX 7 for FREE from:

		http://www.microsoft.com/directx

Q. When I exit the game why has my Windows desktop either increased or decreased in size?

A. LEGOLAND automatically adjusts the resolution of your Desktop area to 640 x 480 to 
   conform to the requirements of the game.
   If the desktop size does not return to its normal appearance then please see the 
   following information on how to adjust the display properties of your system.

   To change you desktop resolution :

  1. Click START on the taskbar, then choose SETTINGS > CONTROL PANEL.
  2. Choose DISPLAY from the icon list, this will bring up the DISPLAY PROPERTIES panel.
  3. Choose the SETTINGS tab, then select the SCREEN AREA you want e.g. 800 x 600
  4. Apply changes and restart the machine if prompted to.

Q. I noticed some graphical errors during the installation of LEGOLAND. 
   Is this a problem ?

A. NO. This does not affect the installation of LEGOLAND but may arise if you desktop
   color depth is 256 or lower. See Question 1 on details of how to change you color
   depth.

Q. I pressed ALT + TAB to swap between programs and LEGOLAND stopped responding when I 
   switched back. 

A. This problem may occur when running other programs in the background during game play.
   It is recommended that you close all other programs before playing LEGOLAND.

Q. I am running low on disk space and LEGOLAND will not run.

A. If you have little or no space left on your hard drive after the installation of 
LEGOLAND you may encounter some problems trying to run the game. LEGOLAND requires that
you have at least 119MB free AFTER installation, for Windows to create a swapfile for the
game. This is especially important if you are using a minimum specification machine.

Q. I have Windows 95 and I've installed LEGOLAND but NO sound will play during the intro.
   What can I do ?

A. This problem arises when certain multimedia components of Windows 95 are not installed.
   To solve this problem do the following:

	Go to the Control Panel
	Select ADD/REMOVE PROGRAMS
	Select the WINDOWS SETUP tab
	Select MULTIMEDIA
	Make sure all components are checked.

Windows may ask for the Windows 95 CD to install these components.
Reboot your machine and attempt to run LEGOLAND again.
