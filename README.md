# LEGO LEGOLAND Alternate Installer #

An alternate installer for _LEGO:registered: LEGOLAND_, written using [Inno Setup](http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) 
to replace the original 16-bit InstallShield installer.

This project uses code from [@bgbennyboy](https://github.com/bgbennyboy)'s [*Grim Fandango Setup*](https://github.com/bgbennyboy/Grim-Fandango-Setup-and-Launcher)
to pull the files off the disc, modified by Triangle717 to support ANSI and Unicode Inno Setup.

This projetct also uses the *InstallShield v3.x Compression and Maintenance util* (`i3comp.exe`) to extract
the InstallShield CAB archive. It was taken from [*Universal Extractor*](legroom.net/software/uniextract) by [LegRoom.net](http://legroom.net).
